Android MapView Balloons
========================

This project provides an easy way to annotate map overlay items with a simple information balloon when using the Android Maps external library (`com.google.android.maps`). It consists of `BalloonOverlayView`, a view representing the balloon that is displayed over your `MapView` and `BalloonItemizedOverlay`, an abstract extension of `ItemizedOverlay`.

The presentation of the balloons was mostly reverse engineered from Google's Places Directory application. 

Usage
-----

Create a subclass of `BalloonItemizedOverlay` in the same way you would do for the base `ItemizedOverlay` class. Rather than overriding `onTap()` (which is already implemented and final in the subclass to invoke the balloon view display for each item tap), you override `onBalloonTap()` to handle a screen tap event on the balloon itself.

The data displayed in each balloon is mapped to the title and snippet arguments you provide to the constructor of each `OverlayItem`.

The repository contains a working sample application project which fully demonstrates its usage.

Implementation
--------------

As of version 1.1, android-mapviewballoons is an Android Library project. Refer to 'Referencing a library project from an application' in [this document](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html#libraryProject) for instructions on how to include it in your own Android project. Ensure you have the latest Android SDK, tools and Eclipse plugin installed.

To install the library and sample project in Eclipse:

- Select **File, Import, Existing projects into workspace...**
- Select the root folder where you cloned/downloaded the repository to import both projects.
- Use **Project - Clean** if there are any errors.

Whats Missing?
--------------

* Custom balloon layouts and data mappings
* Long press support
* Trackball support (not tested)
* Focus events (not tested)
