Jeff Gilfelt's android-mapviewballoons package, originally sourced from:

  https://github.com/jgilfelt/android-mapviewballoons.git

Only alterations here are rearranging the files to match sbt's conventions
for project layout, and adding the gimmicked R.java file that references
the application's.  (It's a kludge, and the stuff in project.scala to
pick up the resources and source files from this directory is worse, but
even the standard build process requires access to "library project" 
components as source files, and ignores their manifests...)
